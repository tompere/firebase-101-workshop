# firebase-101-workshop

## Overview

An intro workshop to firebase and its core feature for a web client.
This workshop project is based on firebase [friendly chat codelab](https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat/), but adds another layer of abstraction (see [step-x](https://github.com/tompere/firebase-101-workshop/tree/master/steps)*.js files and [api.js](https://github.com/tompere/firebase-101-workshop/blob/master/internals/scripts/api.js)), in order to help javascript/ novice programmers focus on firebase SDK usage, and only implement javascript functions.

## The Workshop
* Workshop code has two modes - **step-0** (`master` git branch) and **full-solution** (`full-solution` git branch).
* The workshop does not require any html/css code, or a use of a javascript framework.
* step-o is full with `TODO` comments, as well as firebase docs references for each step.
